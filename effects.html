    <h2>Effects Implementation-Christina Tagay</h2>
    <p>Effect is implemented by creating an Effect base class that is derived from CInstrument (which is derived from CAUdioNode) so I'm able to 
        access the protected attributes of CAudioNode.
        All effects in their own class CEffect will have access to these attributes in Process method. This process method will be called if it was read in from the score files.
        CSynthesizer will have boolean variables set to true if found in the file and will call the effect's Process function if true.
