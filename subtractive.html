    <h1>Subtractive</h1>    
    <h2>Subtractive Implementation:</h2>
    <p>
        Subtractive is implemented by creating a Subtractive class derived from CInstrument. It has a similar implentation of Step 5 CToneIntrument.
        But instead of using a SineWave, I created a SubWave Class (derived) from CAudioNode, like SineWave. 
        Unlike the sinewave, there is an attribute for the wavetable and has to be set in Start before Generate is called.
        Subtractive has a SubWave member variable that holds the wavetable the instrument plays.
        There are three types of waves: Sawtooth, Square, and Triangle. This is set when the Subtractive Note is set.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sawtooth
        </li>
        <li>
            Square
        </li>
        <li>
            Triangle
        </li>
    </ul>
