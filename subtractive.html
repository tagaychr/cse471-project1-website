    <h2>Subtractive Implementation-Christina Tagay</h2>
    <p>
        Subtractive is implemented by creating a Subtractive class derived from CInstrument. It has a similar implentation of Step 5 CToneIntrument.
        But instead of using a SineWave, I created a SubWave Class (derived) from CAudioNode, like SineWave. 
        Unlike the sinewave, there is an attribute for the wavetable and has to be set in Start before Generate is called.
        Subtractive has a SubWave member variable that holds the wavetable the instrument plays.
        There are three types of waves: Sawtooth, Square, and Triangle. This is set when the Subtractive Note is set.

    <h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Waveform playback from tables
        </li>
        <li>
            Varying pitch playback from tables
        </li>
        <li>
            Envelope generation
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Score Format</h3>
    <pre>
        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;score bpm=&quot;180&quot; beatspermeasure=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;instrument instrument=&quot;Subtractive&quot;&gt;
                &lt;note measure=&quot;1&quot; beat=&quot;1&quot; duration=&quot;3&quot; note=&quot;C4&quot; type=&quot;Triangle&quot;/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>The subtractive score file format will have one new attribute type that specifies the type of wave table</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sawtooth
        </li>
        <li>
            Square
        </li>
        <li>
            Triangle
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rest of the attributes are same as ToneInstrument. Note determines what note is played. Measure and beat determines what measure and beat in mesure the note will be played. Duration determines how long the note will be played</p>
